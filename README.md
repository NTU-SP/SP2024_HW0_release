### What You Should Do
1. Create a "main.c" and print your student ID(Note that the English letters in student ID must be lowercase. Remember to add '\n' in the end. E.g., it should be 'b11902000\n' instead of 'B11902000\n'.). 
2. Create a "Makefile" to compile main.c and the execution file is called "main".
3. Do not submit "main" file generated by Makefile. You should `make clean` before you submit.
4. Upload "main.c" and "Makefile" to Github.
